~~Goodnotes2Anki~~ PAPER2ANKI

## Why?

Hey,
many of you probably are fascinated by the flashcard feature by Goodnotes. I am still very thankful for this feature. Makes Goodnotes not only a note-taking app but also a study app. However, I enjoy using Anki(https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for flashcards a bit more.
But the problem with Anki is following: I don't enjoy making the cards.
I rather write cards than typing them.

## What is PAPER2ANKI?

So with PAPER2ANKI I tried to combine the best of both worlds:

- You can easily write your flashcards in Goodnotes or whatever note-taking app which supports normal pages(Where the exported pdf contains actual pages, not one infinite page like OneNote).
- And you study them through Anki.

For simplicity, you can just use the flashcard template from Goodnotes. Then you write your flashcards and PAPER2ANKI will create an Anki deck from your cards!

BUT keep in mind: The generated deck, will only consist of images. If you want to be able to search them you should use something like AnkiOCR(https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/450181164), that's only a half solution, because it's not for handwritten stuff in mind.  
And also I would like to mention one thing: Synchronize your decks only if you really need to, since these are pictures the decks can take quite some storage on the Anki servers.

## How to use it?

For now it's a python script every run can run. Just check out the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Smponi/Paper2Anki if there are any questions feel free to ask!  
And if there are some bugs please create an issue on GitHub.

Your cards will look something like this:

As you can see I haven't put much work in the designing of the cards yet. I just wanted to start using it.

Yeah that's it. If you want to use Goodnotes(Or any other note-taking app) AND Anki, I hope I could provide a way to do so. :)
