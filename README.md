## Introduction

Paper2Anki is your way to **write** your flashcards. Goodnotes 5 released a gamechanger in my opinion. You just write your flashcards,and you can study with them.
However, I don't like the idea of only learning in Goodnotes and their algorithm needs some work imo.
So I decided to create a way to make flashcards in Goodnotes (Or any other notes app) and export them to Anki!

## How to create flashcards

It's just as simple as writing!  
You just write on each page your Question on the top half of the page
and the answer on the bottom part.
Then you just need to export your document as a pdf.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have **python3** installed.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   to install the packages reqiured to run the script.
3. Run `python PdfCutter.py YOURFILE.PDF NAME`  
   So you give the program 2 Arguments:
   1. The PDF file which contains the flash cards
   2. The name you wish the deck to have.
4. Import the .apkg file into Anki

## TODOS:

- [ ] compress the pictures better, so the deck don't need so much space
- [ ] Make Code a bit cleaner
- [ ] Website? Like notion2anki
- [ ] Credits
- [ ] Example
- [ ] Opensource License.
